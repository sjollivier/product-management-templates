# Project Brief for Planning and Scoping
## Project Name
Provide a short phrase that captures the essence of the effort in the language of the beneficiary of this effort. This name will be used in many ways and at many levels once the project is underway. All stakeholders wonder what we're working on. A bad name signals a possibly ill conceived effort and then requires a lot of effort to reduce the entropy caused by a vague or narrow name.

## Project Type (Delivery or Discovery)
Define the type of project. Delivery projects are the standard feature delivery for production deployment with hard requirements. Discovery projects involve a smaller team and usually result in  a throwaway prototype, but are vital in terms of validating a future winning feature or product and establishing its requirements so it can be delivered efficiently with low risk.

## Summary of Problem/Opportunity
Focus on a concise and precise description of the rationale for the effort. Enumerate in bulleted points the problem or challenges or opportunity that will be addressed.

## Example Press Release Quote or Sales Pitch
Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer or stakeholder that describes how they experienced the benefit. This is what we are aiming for with the effort.  

## Essential Elements of the Solution and User Experience
Describe from the user’s/stakeholder’s perspectives how the solution will improve upon their problem..
Focus on a concise and precise description of the "what" to build so we can scope the effort. This will form the basis for the user story detail. 

## Low Fidelity Wireframe / Conceptual Diagram
Provide some visual description because often times “a picture is worth a thousand words” in terms of communicating to people that need to deliver on the desired project outcome. For example, show a wireframe that helps readers understand what might be delivered in the UI to solve the problem. This should not be considered a design and should instead be considered a conversation starter, an input to the design team.

## Early Adopter / Customer References
List 3-5 customers that we will engage to validate requirements, designs, prototypes, early access, and first production use. We will evaluate progress on engaging these people throughout the project. 

## Measures of Success
Provide some trackable measure of how success of the effort will be assessed. Examples include a desired level of adoption over a year, usage by customers representing some aggregate ARR, direct ARR lift if sold as a modulde, performance lift associated with a recommendation model, COGS saving over a year, etc. We will return to these measures during monthly, quarterly, and annual retrospectives.

## Plan for Resolving Risk
Provide action items and owners for assessing and resolving the following four risk factors. We will revisit these throughout the project. 

### Value and Viability
How will we validate that it truly generates value and that we can actually market and sell it at scale as a business? 
### Usablility  
How will we validate that it's usable by the intended audience of users? Who will we be showing it to?
### Feasibility  
How will we validate that we can build and scale it? What will be the expected load that we'll need to plan for and test?

## FAQ 
Concisely summarize a running FAQ that results from reviews and collaboration of this document. Keep it in POV of the beneficiary of the effort (usually the customer).
