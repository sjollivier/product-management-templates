# Project Brief for Planning and Scoping
## Project Name
Provide a short phrase that captures the essence of the effort in the language of the beneficiary of this effort. This name will be used in many ways and at many levels once the project is underway. All stakeholders wonder what we're working on. A bad name signals a possibly ill conceived effort and then requires a lot of effort to reduce the entropy caused by a vague or narrow name.

***Example:*** Mobile Device Usage Report

## Project Type (Delivery or Discovery)
Define the type of project. Delivery projects are the standard feature delivery for production deployment with hard requirements. Discovery projects involve a smaller team and usually result in  a throwaway prototype, but are vital in terms of validating a future winning feature or product and establishing its requirements so it can be delivered efficiently with low risk.

***Example:*** Delivery

## [Working Backwards](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html) - Example Press Release Quote or Sales Pitch
Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer or stakeholder that describes how they experienced the benefit. This is what we are aiming for with the effort.  

***Example:*** With the new ESP XYZ Mobile device usage reports, I was able to make a business case for investing in mobile-optimized email templates, complete the project, and see a 30% lift in engagement and conversions from my email programs. These reports gave me absolute transparency on what percentage of my audience was viewing my emails on a mobile device and how that varied over the week. All in all, I saw huge ROI with very little extra work once I revamped my templates to be mobile-optimized.

## Summary of Problem/Opportunity
Focus on a concise and precise description of the rationale for the effort. Enumerate in bulleted points the problem or challenges or opportunity that will be addressed.

***Example (from back in the day):*** One of the primary themes and business questions in the email marketing business this year is “To what extent is my audience interacting with my email via mobile devices?” This is often followed up by the question “And what should I do about it?” Currently, we have no direct way to answer this business question outside of directing customers to third party offerings such as - - - or using professional services (which are finite and relatively expensive). The downside of these approaches is setup friction, cost, and pushing users outside of our product.

Further, there is a downstream strategy and creative services opportunity to exposing and documenting the magnitude of mobile usage in a customer’s audience. Specifically, if the answer to the question about mobile consumption of a brand’s email is greater than 25%, which is quite likely given industry benchmarks, then our response is to offer strategy and creative services to revamp a brand’s email templates to be more mobile friendly. 

As a result, it is believed that delivering an out-of-the box report on mobile device usage directly addresses a looming demand in the market, expected of any leading ESP, and offers the opportunity for services add-on business.

## Essential Elements of the Solution
Describe from the user’s/stakeholder’s perspectives how the solution will improve upon their problem..
Focus on a concise and precise description of the what to build so we can scope the effort. 

***Example (from back in the day):***
The CEO says to the VP of Marketing “Did you know that your emails look like crap on my iPhone? How many of our customers are using iPhones to read your email in the last 3 months? If they are having the same experience I’m having, then I think we need to something about it and pronto.” Then, since stuff flows downhill, the VP of Marketing then says to the users of the email marketing application “what’s our engagement via mobile devices, and they say hey no problem, our ESP AE just told me that they have a report that will help me provide you with the following types of answers:”
- In the last month, 40% of our opens occurred on a mobile device and 60% on the desktop.
- In the last quarter, only 20% clicks occurred via a mobile device.
- In the last month, iPhones represented 80% of the mobile devices used by our audience.
- In the last two months, Outlook represented our biggest desktop email client in terms of opens and clicks.

The marketing user then visits the report to answer business questions around mobile and email client usage for a given period of time. The report is expected to have the following basic behavior and requirements:

1. Campaign-level and or by day count aggregation
2. Ability to report on a user-defined start and end date: users should be able to specify their own start and end date for their report.
3. Ability to view open and click counts and share by device type: Users should be able to look at counts for a given time period for each device type (desktop, mobile, other).
4. Ability to view open and click counts by device type device types within the mobile device category: Users should be able to look at counts for a given time period for each mobile device type (iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows phone, Blackberry, Other).
5. Ability to view open and click counts and share for email client type: Users should be able to look at counts for a given time period for each email client (Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo, etc.).
6. Time/Day of Week Report: Allow  users to assess to what extent users are viewing through a mobile or desktop device. For example, users would be able to see that on Saturdays on average mobile devices account for 60% of opens but on Mondays they account for 20% of opens.


## Low Fidelity Wireframe / Conceptual Diagram
Provide some visual description because often times “a picture is worth a thousand words” in terms of communicating to people that need to deliver on the desired project outcome. For example, show a wireframe that helps readers understand what might be delivered in the UI to solve the problem. This should not be considered a design and should instead be considered a conversation starter, an input to the design team.

## Early Adopter / Customer References
List 3-5 customers that we will engage to validate requirements, designs, prototypes, early access, and first production use. We will evaluate progress on engaging these people throughout the project. 

## Estimated Financial Impact
Provide some basis for how the enhancement drives revenue. For example, a feature gap that will allow us to onboard $2MM in ARR. Or a feature that has been identified as critical to 20 customers representing $20MM in ARR. Or a feature that has been identified as costing us $10MM in ARR in lost deals. Or some COGS reduction.

## Measures of Success
Provide some trackable measure of how success of the effort will be assessed. Examples include a desired level of adoption over a year, usage by customers representing some aggregate ARR, direct ARR lift if sold as a modulde, performance lift associated with a recommendation model, COGS saving over a year, etc. We will return to these measures during monthly, quarterly, and annual retrospectives.

## Plan for Resolving Risk
Provide action items and owners or assessing and resolving the following four risk factors. We will revisit these throughout the project. 

### Viability  
### Value  
### Feasibility  
### Usablility  

## FAQ 
Concisely summarize a running FAQ that results from reviews and collaboration of this document. Keep it in POV of the beneficiary of the effort (usually the customer).
